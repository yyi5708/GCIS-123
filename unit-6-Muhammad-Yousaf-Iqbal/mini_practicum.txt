Unit 03 Practice Problems

For the remainder of this semester, you will begin each new unit by solving a
set of practice problems based on the material from the previous unit. You will
have 30 minutes to complete your answers and push your solution to GitHub. 
Raise your hand if you need help.

The goal of these "mini practica" is to give you practice with coding problems
similar to those that you will see on the midterm practica. You will be 
required to solve each problem with minimal assistance. You should use these
mini-practica as an opportunity to gage your preparedness for the exams.

Each mini-practicum counts as a homework assignment. Each of the numbered 
problems below is weighted equally. 


QUESTIONS

1. Find the Rabbit. 

In the repo for this week (or MyCourses), you will find a Python file named "practice.py". 
It contains functions/stubs that you will need to implement. 

The first function, find_rabbit(), should return the number of times the word "Rabbit" appears in the story 'Alice and Wonderland'. The file alice.txt has been provided. 

You must complete this function keeping in mind the following:
-  You may ignore instances of "Rabbit" that are adjacent to punctuation or other characters. (29 instances expected)
-  You are searching strictly for the capitalized version of the word, "Rabbit".

2. Regular Expressive Rabbits

Implement the second function to achieve the same thing, but using Regular Expressions to search. 

-You are not allowed to use split(). 
-You will now find instances of the word even if they are next to punctuation, like "Rabbit!"
(45 instances)
