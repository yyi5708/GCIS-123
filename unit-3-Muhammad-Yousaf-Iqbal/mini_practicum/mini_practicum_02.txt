Unit 02 Practice Problems

The goal of these "mini practica" is to give you practice with coding problems
similar to those that you will see on the midterm practica. You will be 
required to solve each problem with minimal assistance. You should use these
mini-practica as an opportunity to gage your preparedness for the exams.

You should create all of your required files in this folder along with these
instructions.

Each mini-practicum counts as a homework assignment. Each of the numbered 
problems below is weighted equally. 


1. Create a new Python module in a file named "practice.py" and define a 
function named "convert_height." The function should prompt the user to enter 
their height in inches, and then print the height back to the user in feet and
inches.

  a. Your function needs only handle whole numbers of inches, i.e. the user 
     will not enter fractional inches as floating-point numbers.

  b. You should produce output that matches the example below as closely as 
     possible, including the use of ' to indicate feet, and " to indicate 
     inches in the output.

  c. Example output:

     Enter your height in inches: 71
     You are 5' 11" tall


2. In the same module define a function named "snow_man" that declares 
parameters for  x, y coordinates at the bottom of the bottom snowball, and a 
radius. Use turtle to draw an image similar to the example provided in the 
snow_man.png file. You must demonstrate reuse by avoiding duplicate blocks of 
code; you may define any helper functions that you see fit. 
  
  a. The background color in the example is "cyan", but you can use any color
     that you would like.

  b. The bottom snowball should use the argument passed in for the radius.

  c. The middle snowball is 75% of the radius of the bottom. The head is 75% of
     the radius of the middle.

Call your function from main. Don't forget to use input() to keep the window 
from closing.
