Unit 06 Practice Problems

The goal of these "mini practica" is to give you practice with coding problems
similar to those that you will see on the midterm practica. You will be 
required to solve each problem with minimal assistance. You should use these
mini-practica as an opportunity to gage your preparedness for the exams.

You should create all of your required files in this folder along with these
instructions.

Each mini-practicum counts as a homework assignment. Each of the numbered 
problems below is weighted equally. 

You have provided with unit tests for both parts in practice_test.py.  Note
that you will have failing tests until both solutions are fully implemented.
    
1. To The Max
   a. Create a new python module named "practice.py" and define a function named
      "max".  Declare parameters for an array, an index (default value 0), and
      maximum value (default value None).
      
      Your function must use recursion to find and return the maximum value in
      the array.  If the array is 0 length, your function should return None.
   
      Example Usage
        an_array = array_utils.range_array(0,10)
        largest = max(an_array)
        print(largest)
  
        Output: 9

2. You've Got The Power
   a. In your "practice.py" module, define a function named "power".  Declare
      2 parameters: base and exponent.  You should not add additional
      parameters.
      
      Recall from the lecture that a naive implementation of a mathematical
      formula translates the formula as directly as possible into code, making
      changes only to fit the language syntax.  Your function must use recursion
      to implement the following divide-and-conquer power calculation:

      P(B,E) = Undefined where E < 0
      P(B,E) = 1 where E = 0
      P(B,E) = B where E = 1
      P(B,E) = B * P(B,E//2) * P(B,E//2) where E is odd
      P(B,E) = P(B,E//2) * P(B,E//2) where E is even

      where B = base and E = exponent and both are always integers

      Example Usage
        result = power(4,7)
        print(result)

        Output: 16384
