Unit 04 Practice Problems

For the remainder of this semester, you will begin each new unit by solving a
set of practice problems based on the material from the previous unit. You will
have 30 minutes to complete your answers and push your solution to GitHub. 
Raise your hand if you need help.

The goal of these "mini practica" is to give you practice with coding problems
similar to those that you will see on the midterm practica. You will be 
required to solve each problem with minimal assistance. You should use these
mini-practica as an opportunity to gage your preparedness for the exams.

Each mini-practicum counts as a homework assignment. The numbered 
problems below are weighted equally. 


1. Create a new Python module in a file named "pi_quiz.py" and implement a function named "pi_tester" which takes no parameters. Your function needs to meet the following requirements:

    a. Your function should prompt the user to enter the decimal digits of pi in order, up to the first 100 decimal places.
    b. As each digit is entered, compare it against the solution. If it is correct, ask for the next digit. If it is not, print an error message with the correct digit.
    c. Repeat until an incorrect digit is entered or 100 correct digits are entered.
    d. The function should return the number of correct decimal digits that were entered.

Note: The value of pi to 100 decimal places is, 3.1415926535897932384626433832795028841971693993751058209749445923078164062862089986280348253421170679

2. In your "pi_quiz" module, implement a display_score function that takes a score as its only parameter. Your function needs to meet the following requirements:
    a. Display a message indicating the number of correct decimal digits and the user's title, which is defined below:

Score 0 - 4: PI Neophyte
Score 5 - 9: PI Novice
Score 10 - 24: PI Journeyman
Score 25 - 49: PI Enthusiast
Score 50 - 96: PI Connoisseur
Score 97 - 100: PI Expert
Score 100+: PI Imposter (this state is only reachable if there is an error in the code)

    b. Write a main function that calls pi_tester and passes the results to display score.

Note: The file pi_100_digits_one_per_line.txt has been provided to aid in testing. You can copy however many digits you want from the file and paste them on the command line of your running pi_quiz. This will save you the time of hand entering the values.


Submission Instructions
