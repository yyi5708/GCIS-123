# Final Practicum

* There are four coding problems for you to solve:
1. Classes - 35 pts
2. Queues - 20 pts
3. Stacks - 20 pts
4. Node Sequences - 25 pts
* Each of the problems comes with a set of pytest functions in a separate file.
* Your goal is to make all of the tests pass.  You may add tests if you like.
