Unit 07 Practice Problems (Unit 8 Day 1 mini practicum)

The goal of these "mini practica" is to give you practice with coding problems
similar to those that you will see on the midterm practica. You will be 
required to solve each problem with minimal assistance. You should use these
mini-practica as an opportunity to gauge your preparedness for the exams.

You should create all of your required files in this folder along with these
instructions.

Each mini-practicum counts as a homework assignment. 
======================

1. Add a decreasing_comparator(a,b) function (introduced in earlier material) to the array_utils module.  
It returns True if b <= a, False otherwise.
You have been provided the increasing_comparator(a,b) function, which returns True if b >= a, False otherwise  

2. Add a function named is_sorted to the array_utils module. 
The function is_sorted has parameters: an_array, and comparator=increasing_comparator (default value)
is_sorted returns True if the array is either sorted or reverse sorted depending on the comparator being used, False otherwise. 

Test is_sorted from main using both increasing and decreasing comparators.
Using array1 = [20, 10, 30] and array2 = [30, 20, 10] as an example, expected output of the function is as follows:
>>> is_sorted(array1) 
False
>>> is_sorted(array1, decreasing_comparator)
False
>>> is_sorted(array2, increasing_comparator)
False
>>> is_sorted(array2, decreasing_comparator)
True
