Unit 09 Practice Problems (Unit 10 Day 1 mini-practicum)

The goal of these "mini practica" is to give you practice with coding problems
similar to those that you will see on the midterm practica. You will be 
required to solve each problem with minimal assistance. You should use these
mini-practica as an opportunity to gauge your preparedness for the exams.

You should create all of your required files in this folder along with these
instructions.

Each mini-practicum counts as a homework assignment. 
=====================================================
Create a python module named mini_practium9.py and write the following functions.

1. The make_letter_frequency function declares a parameter filename 
and creates a dictionary that counts the number of times that each alphabet 
letter is used in the text file and returns it. Convert the letters to 
lower case and do not include any digits or punctuation in your dictionary.

2. The print_letter_frequency declares a parameter for a letter-counting 
dictionary and prints each letter and its frequency on a separate line. 
The function should also print the most popular letter with its 
frequency at the end. 

3. Two text files, alice.txt and rit_mission.txt, have been provided 
for you to test your functions. In your main, test your functions with 
each text file:

def main():
    #filename = 'data/rit_mission.txt'
    filename = 'data/alice.txt'
    freq_dict = make_letter_frequency(filename)
    ...

Using alice.txt as an example, your output should look like:  
p: 1968
r: 6612
o: 9478
...
The most popular letter: e 15398
