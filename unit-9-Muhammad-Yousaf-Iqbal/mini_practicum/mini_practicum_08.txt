Unit 08 Practice Problems (Unit 9 Day 1 mini-practicum)

The goal of these "mini practica" is to give you practice with coding problems
similar to those that you will see on the midterm practica. You will be 
required to solve each problem with minimal assistance. You should use these
mini-practica as an opportunity to gauge your preparedness for the exams.

You should create all of your required files in this folder along with these
instructions.

Each mini-practicum counts as a homework assignment. 
===========================================

1. The in_place_reverse function declares a parameter a_list and uses the 
built-in pop and insert functions to reverse the list without using additional 
memory. What is the time complexity of the new function? Test the function in 
a main function using a simple list.

2. The make_multiplication_table function returns a 10x10 multiplication table 
as a 2D list. The ith row must contain multiples of i: i*1, i*2, â€¦, i*10. Test 
the function from main and print each row on a separate line. If you can solve
this using only one line of code, you'll get full credit. Using multiple lines
will reduce your score by 10 points.
